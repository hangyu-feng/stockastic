Stock price prediction using machine learning

## python packages

- [tensorflow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/)

- [alpha_vantage](https://pypi.org/project/alpha-vantage/)

## Notes

- I decided not to use pickle and other for now. The reason being that although it may boost data loading performance, it may cause other issues and is not human readable. I will stick to csv until there is performance issue in reading/writing files.
